## Requirements

The system should have the following promotions:
- Each sale of a MacBook Pro comes with a free Raspberry Pi B
- Buy 3 Google Homes for the price of 2
- Buying more than 3 Alexa Speakers will have a 10% discount on all Alexa speakers

## Examples
Scanned Items: MacBook Pro, Raspberry Pi B
Total: $5,399.99
Scanned Items: Google Home, Google Home, Google Home
Total: $99.98
Scanned Items: Alexa Speaker, Alexa Speaker, Alexa Speaker
Total: $295.65

## Intructions
Please write it in Golang or Node with a CI script that runs tests and produces a binary.
Finally, imagine that adding items to cart and checking out was a backend API. Please design a schema file for GraphQL on how you would do this.
